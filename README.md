This repository is a collection of projects completed for my Computer Vision class at Queens College.

***Disclaimer***
Each directory has its own "specs" PDF that will list the command line arguments necessary for execution.

Below are the descriptions and visualizations of what each project does.

Project 1:
  
  Accepts a grey-scale image as input and the creates a bi-modal histogram based on the information gathered. Using a deepest concavity algorithm, determines the value that is 
  most likely to be the boundary between an object pixel and background pixel. The original image is then converted into a binary image that only displays pixels over this     
  selected threshold value, therefore isolating the object and removing excess noise.
